# Pipeline Cache

> Once created, a pipeline cache can be passed to the ***\*`vkCreateGraphicsPipelines`\**** and ***\*`vkCreateComputePipelines`\**** commands. If the pipeline cache passed into these commands is not `VK_NULL_HANDLE`, the implementation will query it for possible reuse opportunities and update it with new content. The use of the pipeline cache object in these commands is internally synchronized, and the same pipeline cache object can be used in multiple threads simultaneously.
